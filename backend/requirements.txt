Build REST APIs for Login and Register in Node.js with JWT token authentication and user roles
 
User roles : 1) super-admin
			 2) client-admin
			 3) client-user
Register sample payload ==> {
    "username": "xyz",
    "email": "xyz",
    "password": "xyz",
	"mobile number": "123",
	"address line_1": "abc",
	"address line_2": "abc",
	"pincode": "123",
    "roles": ["roles"]
}
 
Requirements:
 
- The registration response should store data with a UUIDv7 in the database.
- Login should be done using the username and password ,as response to be generated JWT token.

Update:
	1) User Registration and Email Verification:
		- Implement user registration with email verification. After users register, send them a confirmation email containing an OTP (one-time password) or a link to verify their email address.
		- Ensure that the verification process is secure and user-friendly.
	2) Invitation Workflow:
		- Create an invitation system where:
	> Super admins can invite client admins.
	> Client admins can invite users.
		- Design an API for handling invitations, including necessary parameters (e.g., email addresses, roles, etc..).
